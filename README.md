### 👋 Hi there!
## I am a:

 💻 Software Engineer 💻 🎮 Game Developer 🎮 🎵 Musician 🎵 <br/> <br/> 👷 and open for work! 😉 

## 🛠️ Currently, I am working on:
-  Dalaya: a custom Emulated EverQuest server. Come play with us! 
    - [Website](https://dalaya.org/)
    - [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jm9CuWpAZw)
- A log parser for Everquest, with a connected database to share data with others (especially developers)
    - My ideas for this project so far:
        - Damage | Healer | Tank parsing
        - Loot Logs
        - separate logger that displays what items/creatures are in what zones
        - Tradeskill Logs
        - A database and website that shows the stored data
- Personal portfolios:
